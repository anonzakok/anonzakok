# Hi, I am Anon Tason :+1:

### A Front End Developer

I'm from Bangkok, Thailand, a place of beauty and nature. Since childhood, I love computer games. I tend to play computer for ten hours a day. I also like creating things that are useful to others.

I started coding when I was in high school. Coding is a game for me too. I love it and now I have the opportunity to code. I found it really interesting. And I really enjoyed the process.

My vision is to make the world a better place. Now almost everything is getting worse. It's time for us to do good things that make the world a better place.
